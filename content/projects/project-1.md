## The Challenge

Solara's product suite had grown to five distinct applications, each with its own design language. Engineers were spending 30% of their time building custom UI components instead of focusing on product features.

## My Role

As the lead design systems designer, I was responsible for:

- Auditing existing UI patterns across all five products
- Defining a unified design token architecture
- Building the Figma component library with auto-layout and variants
- Collaborating with the engineering team on React component implementation

## Process

1. **Audit & Research** — Cataloged 400+ unique UI patterns, identified 60 core components
2. **Token Architecture** — Designed a three-tier token system (primitive → semantic → component)
3. **Component Library** — Built 60 Figma components with comprehensive variant coverage
4. **Documentation** — Created usage guidelines and migration playbooks

## Results

- **40% reduction** in design-to-development handoff time
- **60% fewer** custom one-off components built by engineers
- **Unified experience** across all five products within 3 months
