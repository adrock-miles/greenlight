## The Challenge

Existing travel apps focus on popular tourist destinations and hotel bookings. Waypoint needed to carve out a niche for adventure travelers who prefer unique, local experiences over mainstream tourism.

## My Role

I led the end-to-end design process from user research through final UI delivery:

- Conducted interviews with 25 adventure travelers
- Created journey maps and user personas
- Designed the complete iOS app experience
- Built interactive Framer prototypes for usability testing

## Key Design Decisions

- **Map-first navigation** — The map is the primary interface, not a list of results
- **Local curator profiles** — Each destination is curated by a verified local guide
- **Offline-ready cards** — Trip details are designed to work without internet connectivity

## Process

1. **Research** — 25 user interviews, competitive analysis of 8 travel apps
2. **Ideation** — Design sprint with the founding team, 50+ concepts explored
3. **Design** — High-fidelity designs for 35 screens across 6 core flows
4. **Testing** — 3 rounds of usability testing, iterating on navigation patterns

## Results

- **4.8/5** average usability score in testing
- **92% task completion** rate for core booking flow
- Launched to **10,000 beta users** in the first month
