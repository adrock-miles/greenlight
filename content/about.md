With over eight years of experience in product design, I've helped startups and established companies ship products that people love to use.

My approach combines **systems thinking** with a deep empathy for end users. I believe great design isn't just about aesthetics — it's about creating clarity, reducing friction, and empowering people to achieve their goals.

## What I Do

- **Design Systems** — Building scalable component libraries and token architectures that keep teams aligned
- **Product Design** — End-to-end product thinking from research and strategy through pixel-perfect delivery
- **Prototyping** — High-fidelity interactive prototypes that communicate ideas better than any spec document

## Tools & Methods

Figma, Framer, After Effects, usability testing, jobs-to-be-done framework, design sprints, and a healthy obsession with spacing grids.
